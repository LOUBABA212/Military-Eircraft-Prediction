## **Project Overview**  

**Aircrafteam** is an advanced aircraft classification system designed to accurately identify and categorize military and civil aircraft. Developed by students of the **National School of Applied Sciences of Tetouan** under the supervision of **Professor Hachchane Imane**, this project leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques to enhance the precision of aircraft recognition.  

## **Motivation**  

Classifying military aircraft is a complex challenge due to:  
- The need to distinguish between similar-looking models (e.g., **Be-200, Tornado, RQ-4**).  
- The classification of aircraft into **fighter, civil, transport, reconnaissance, and other categories**.  
- The diverse operational conditions and variations in aircraft designs.  
- The requirement for high-speed and high-accuracy classification in real-world applications.  

Our solution employs **deep learning architectures** to improve classification accuracy, helping both military and civil aviation authorities effectively monitor and manage airspace.  

## **Technologies Used**  

### **Machine Learning Models**  
- **ResNet50** – A deep residual network for image classification.  
- **YOLOv8** – A state-of-the-art object detection model.  
- **VGG** – A convolutional neural network (CNN) known for image recognition tasks.  

### **Frameworks & Tools**  
- **Flask** – Used for deploying and managing the training process.  
- **Python** – Primary programming language for data processing and model training.  
- **Google Drive** – Storage for trained models and datasets.
